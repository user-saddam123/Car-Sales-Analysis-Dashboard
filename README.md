### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
#

### Project Goals

I recently completed a car sales analysis project for an American car dealership. The goal of the project was to design and develop a dynamic and interactive car sales dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes critical KPIs related to car sales, helping the dealership understand their sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
#

### Tools Used

 - Excel- Data Cleaning
 - Power BI- Data Visualization and Analysis
#

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following task:
 1. Data Loading and inspection.
 2. Handling Missing Values.
 3. Removing Blanks Value and outliers.
 4. Data Cleaning and Formating.

#

### Problem staement 1: KPI's Requirment
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.

1.Sales Overview:
  - Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
  - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales

2. Average Price Analysis
  - YTD Average Price
  - YOY Growth in Average Price

3. Cars Sold Metrics:
  - YTD Cars Sold
  - YOY Growth in Cars Sold
#

### Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement
1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.

2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.

3. YTD Total Sales by Color: Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a donut chart.

4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

5. Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.
#

### Key Findings/Insights

The dashboard provides a wealth of insights into the dealership's car sales performance. Some of the key findings include:

 - Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales: A remarkable $371.2 million.
 - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales: An impressive 23.59% increase.
 - YTD Average Price: Stands at $28,000.
 - YOY Growth in Average Price: Slightly down at -0.75%.
 - YTD Cars Sold: An incredible 13,300 units.
 - YOY Growth in Cars Sold: A whopping 24.57% rise.

 - YTD Total Sales by Body Style: SUVs take the lead.
 - YTD Total Sales by Color: Pearl White cars stand out with 11.26k sales, followed by black and red cars.
