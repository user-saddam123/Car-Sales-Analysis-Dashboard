# Car-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

I recently completed a car sales analysis project for an American car dealership. The goal of the project was to design and develop a dynamic and interactive car sales dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes critical KPIs related to car sales, helping the dealership understand their sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

Key Findings:

The dashboard provides a wealth of insights into the dealership's car sales performance. Some of the key findings include:
Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales: A remarkable $371.2 million.
Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales: An impressive 23.59% increase.
YTD Average Price: Stands at $28,000.
YOY Growth in Average Price: Slightly down at -0.75%.
YTD Cars Sold: An incredible 13,300 units.
YOY Growth in Cars Sold: A whopping 24.57% rise.

Additional Insights:
YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Notable peaks in weeks 39, 46, and 50.
YTD Total Sales by Body Style: SUVs take the lead.
YTD Total Sales by Color: Pearl White cars stand out with 11.26k sales, followed by black and red cars.
YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: The Austin region emerges as the top performer with around 4,135 sales.

Moreover, our analysis reveals the following:
✔Top 5 Companies by Car Sales:
Chevrolet leads the way with 1,819 cars sold.
Dodge follows closely with 1,671.
Ford with 1,614.
Volkswagen with 1,333.
Mercedes-Benz with 1,285.

✔ We've also identified the top 4 and bottom 4 dealers by car sales, making it easy to discern who the top performers are and who needs improvement.

✔Additionally, we've analyzed car sales by region and color, providing clear insights into which car colors are performing well in specific regions.
